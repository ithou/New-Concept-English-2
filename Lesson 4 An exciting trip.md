a great number of ≈ a lot of.

## 其他

### 为什么是 ... is finding ? 
书上的`So he is finding this trip very exciting.`find用正在进行时翻译为**发现了**，而不翻译为**正在发现**。

### 正在进行时态表达将来
go、come、leave、arrive

### arrive不能和一段时间连用

go in：`in` 做**副词**，后面很少加宾语。类似于 come in
> May I come in ?
> He went in.

go to：接**宾语**，
> go to theatre.
> go to the Place Museum.

go into：接**宾语**，指有去的动作，以及 **`进入`** 的动作
